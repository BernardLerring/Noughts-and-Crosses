- [Medium](https://medium.com/byte-tales/the-classic-tic-tac-toe-game-in-python-3-1427c68b8874) was used for a framework for the code.

### Personal Development

- My understanding of Python was far better than Javascript leading in to this project. I find it cleaner to look at, and simpler to work with. Going forward, I would like to use an API to link up a Python project to Google Sheets and have the Python code alter the data like the Love Sandwiches project.

### Thanks

- My Partner for being my UX companion for the site and for helping test it for me.

- My mentor for his feedback and encouragement throughout the project.

- The good people of the Code Institute Slack Channel for helping resolve a query with my code.
