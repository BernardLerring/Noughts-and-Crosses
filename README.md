## Fixed Bugs 

- All media queries resolved size and flow issues on smaller devices.

## Unfixed Bugs

- The score from the previous game is still visible after the restart quiz button is pushed.

- When I created the pagination to produce one question at a time, it broke the "restart quiz" function. I was unable to work out what caused this so I did not include the pagination in the final quiz.

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages by following these steps:

1. In the GitHub repository, find the Settings tab.

2. From the Source section drop down menu select "Main".

3. Press "Refresh".

4. GitHub then creates the live link for the site.

## Credits

### Content

- Image was taken from [Joe](https://www.joe.ie/quiz/ultimate-uk-office-quiz-season-1-695985)

- Some questions were taken from [MentalFloss](https://www.mentalfloss.com/quizzes/13559/office-quiz-uk-edition)

- Code used for the main quiz Javascript structure was taken from [SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/simple-javascript-quiz/)

### Personal Development

- I have struggled to get my head around Javascript, so the site is quite simplistic. With the tight timeframe to get this project submitted I played it safe, but would like to revisit Javascript at another time to try and fully understand the syntax, layout and functions used.

- Future versions of the site would have updated questions and an area to submit your own questions.

- A future site would also include a leaderboard to store multiple users scores.

### Thanks

- My Partner for being my UX companion for the site and for helping test it for me.

- My mentor for his feedback and encouragement throughout the project.
